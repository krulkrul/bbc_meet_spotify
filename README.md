# bbc_meet_spotify
Simple tool to convert BBC radio station playlists into spotify playists

## Why

BBC used to be friendly for spotify users and create spotify playlists of their A, B and C-list songs for that week.
It looks like when they moved everything to BBC Sounds, that they wanted to make people use it, so stopped putting
their playlists on Spotify. This is a low effort way to get those playlists back on spotify.

### Other options that didn't work for me:

- [rdfaudio](https://github.com/hubgit/rdfaudio)  (Javascripy chrome plugin) never populated a playlist for me.
- [spotify_bb6](https://github.com/louridas/spotify_bbc6/blob/master/spotify_bbc6.py) (python) relied on spotify 
  links existing on the bbc page, the weekly playlist doesn't have this anymore so additional work 
  scraping the track info and then searching spotify was needed
- [beebify](https://github.com/adamobeng/beebify) (python) scraped the information from a different format
  of bbc playlist which didn't work for the weekly playlists sadly.
- [bbcr1-spotify](https://github.com/denysvitali/bbcr1-spotify) (Crystal) seemed like it would only populate playlist 
  with bbc radio 1 now playing
  
## Installation & setup

1. Clone repository 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stefpiatek/bbc_meet_spotify.git
    ```

2. With **Python 3.6 or higher**, set up virtual environment
    
    ```bash
    cd bbc_meet_spotify
    # Create the virtual environment
    python3.6 -m venv .venv 
    # Enable the virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install requirements

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Follow the instructions for [authorisation of spotify apps](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#authorized-requests)
   (which involves [registering your app](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)). 
   The name of the application can be whatever you'd like. 

5. Copy the `config_example.toml` to a new file `config.toml`.
   - Fill in the config `client_id` and `client_secret` from the application you registered with spotify.
   - Fill in your spotify `username` field.
